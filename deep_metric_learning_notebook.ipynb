    "Classical machine learning classification uses cross entropy loss. It works well when classes are well-seperated, but struggles in real-world scenarios where:\n",
    "1. High intra-class variance: Samples from the same class look very different(e.g; the same person photographed from different angles,lightening and angles).\n",
